# Testing instructions

From the root folder (`noq/`, not this directory), run `python -m test.test` to test all puzzles.

To test a subset of puzzles, supply the names (IDs) of the puzzles at the end, e.g. `python -m test.test easyas tll`.

Expect a bunch of stuff to get printed to your terminal as the solvers run; test results will appear at the very end.
